# Odin-Recipes
This is my first project for Web development. From the start it will show only my skills of writing git commits and using HTML. Will be maintained as project goes on.
# what I have learned through this project
- I learned how to create basic HTML elements.
- I managed to create basic file structure for a project and used links to connect it all together.
- I used root-relative and absolute links in a project.
